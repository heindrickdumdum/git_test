1
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:46,223
Gu Seung-jun!

2
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:03,199
Seung-jun, stay with me.

3
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:06,494
Don't worry. I'm okay.

4
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:08,204
No.

5
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,334
Gu Seung-jun.

6
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,086
Gu Seung-jun!

7
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,714
AMBULANCE

8
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:32,353
Hang up another IV fluid bag

9
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,438
and check her vital signs again.

10
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,065
Ms. Yoon.

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,233
Ms. Yoon.

12
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,458
Inject epinephrine through the IV line.

13
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,501
Yes, Doctor.

14
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,187
Ms. Yoon, can you hear me? Ms. Yoon.

15
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,606
-Start CPR.
-Yes, Doctor.

16
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,775
-Get the defibrillator ready.
-Got it.

17
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:22,361
We'll begin defibrillation.
Charge to 150 joules.

18
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,447
Charged.

19
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:27,157
One, two, three.

20
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,827
Charge to 200 joules.

21
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,122
-Charged.
-One, two, three.

22
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,964
Are you okay?

23
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,924
Stay with me.

24
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,927
Look at me.

25
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,929
Look straight at me.

26
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,266
You told me...

27
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,979
that when you're doing better...

28
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,481
Later on, if I visit you

29
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,735
when I am doing better...

30
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,072
And if

31
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:09,700
you are

32
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,453
still single...

33
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,541
Then please give me...

34
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,377
<i>a chance.</i>

35
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,007
I was going to give you a chance.

36
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:29,928
I was going to wait until you visit me.

37
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,641
I was going to wait for you.

38
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:35,476
<i>I like you, Dan.</i>

39
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,479
Because I like you,

40
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:41,982
I will keep in mind where I am going.

41
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,237
I will live that way.

42
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:53,786
I will do that from now on.

43
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:55,746
I was happy.

44
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,336
Hearing that...

45
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:06,924
made me happy.

46
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,229
Dan.

47
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:26,610
That time,

48
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:30,823
what were you referring to?

49
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:34,910
<i>Ramyeon</i>?

50
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:38,747
That man?

51
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:40,541
Or...

52
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:43,961
me?

53
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,131
Why not?

54
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,467
I like it.

55
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:55,222
What?

56
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:58,100
You like what? <i>Ramyeon</i>?

57
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:01,353
Or did you mean that man?

58
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:03,230
Or...

59
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:06,024
me?

60
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,116
You.

61
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:16,243
It was you.

62
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,121
It was you, Gu Seung-jun.

63
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:23,000
I knew it.

64
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,060
Gu Seung-jun.

65
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:44,271
Gu Seung-jun.

66
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:46,940
Seung-jun.

67
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,074
Excuse me.

68
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,286
I think he fainted. Please do something.

69
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:03,582
Do something, please. Anything.

70
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:04,750
I feel

71
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:08,253
so bad for him.

72
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:12,800
Please do something. Please!

73
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,554
Wake up.

74
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,974
Wake up.

75
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:24,102
Please wake up, Seung-jun.

76
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:25,813
Please.

77
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,773
Seung-jun...

78
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:37,241
It's back.

79
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,620
-Give her the full amount of oxygen.
-Yes, Doctor.

80
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,305
She's stable now.

81
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:04,309
Let's wait and see how she recovers.

82
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:06,103
All right, then.

83
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,491
We heard she was in critical condition

84
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,369
and thought we should be here.

85
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:23,745
Thank you.

86
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,456
I'm relieved. It sounds like
she passed the critical stage.

87
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,501
Then,

88
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,087
does he have to leave again?

89
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,008
But her condition might worsen.

90
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:40,596
And she might look for him
when she wakes up.

91
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,142
Please see what you can do.

92
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:10,910
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

93
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,922
It's nice to eat together like this.
It's been too long.

94
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,507
Hey, don't laugh.

95
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,468
Sorry?

96
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,679
They might assume that we're some
kooky soldiers seduced by capitalism

97
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,181
and think that we're easy.

98
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:29,603
It's still not safe to assume
that their evil scheme has ended.

99
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:32,731
What scheme?

100
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,983
Think about it.

101
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,904
I'm the most elite agent of the DPRK.

102
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:41,073
They obviously wouldn't want to lose me,

103
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:43,283
especially when I came down here
of my own accord.

104
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:47,120
That's why they're feeding us so well.

105
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,624
To tell you the truth,

106
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,294
I already got an offer.

107
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:55,212
"An offer"?

108
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,506
In American Imperialists' terms,

109
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,969
I guess I can say I got scouted?

110
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,846
We can send you back
if you'd like to return,

111
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,558
but what you wish to do
matters more to us.

112
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,519
What?

113
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:16,817
If you decide to stay,
we can help you get settled.

114
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,162
They want me to stay.

115
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,208
That's how capitalism works.

116
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,710
Just like this saying,

117
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:38,088
"Take what's useful
and ditch what's useless."

118
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,633
They find my skills very useful,
so they're eager to keep me here.

119
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,971
You always talk about
how much you hate capitalism,

120
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:49,016
yet you seem to have already
acquainted yourself with the slangs here.

121
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,060
-Well...
-But the thing is,

122
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:56,982
he asked all of us
the exact same question.

123
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,443
-All of you?
-That's right.

124
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:02,404
You too, Eun Dong?

125
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:06,867
Perhaps they did that
because they were afraid

126
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:12,122
I'd think I'd get lonely and say no if
they asked me to stay here all by myself.

127
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,795
Has anyone seen Captain Ri?

128
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:24,843
Not even once.

129
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:28,680
I tried asking the investigator,
but he won't tell me anything.

130
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:37,439
A WEEK LATER

131
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:41,735
I heard you suggested exchanging those
awaiting repatriation.

132
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:44,780
We have a few from the South

133
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,866
who are serving time in jail
for espionage charges anyway,

134
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,911
so I'd say we and the South
have nothing to lose.

135
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,329
No, it's different.

136
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:55,916
The six soldiers who got arrested
in the South are still being investigated,

137
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,836
whereas the nine South Koreans here
are already serving their sentences.

138
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,046
The difference is huge.

139
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:05,133
It's just us here, so let's be honest.

140
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,219
The Military Department went ahead

141
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:10,514
and prosecuted them without investigating
or putting them on trial.

142
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,350
I bet some of them think it's unfair.

143
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:14,935
Sir.

144
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:19,022
You can never hide an awl in your pocket.

145
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:23,276
You want to cover up
the fact that your son

146
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,903
betrayed us for a woman.

147
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:28,740
That is why you're trying to push ahead
with a deal that is so unfair for us.

148
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:32,828
I'm sure they know
that it's a losing bargain for them.

149
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,788
But they want them back no matter what?

150
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,541
They obviously want
to settle this quickly.

151
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,502
Yes, they want us to hand them over
as soon as possible.

152
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:42,587
And they want to keep it confidential.

153
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:44,714
They want the confidentiality term
to be five years.

154
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:47,008
They're being sensitive about it
because one of them

155
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:48,385
is a high-ranking officer's son.

156
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:51,096
Are we sure that they never engaged
in espionage or any activities

157
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,265
that serve the interest of the North
while being here?

158
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:55,892
Yes. As you can see in the summary
of the investigation report

159
00:11:55,976 --> 00:12:00,021
and the statements signed by them,

160
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:02,274
they didn't really do anything
except for the gunfight

161
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,650
with Cho Cheol Gang.

162
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:06,194
And how do they feel
about going back to the North?

163
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:07,779
They all want to return.

164
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:11,950
Then why don't we send them back
in secret as per the North's request?

165
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,536
Going public with it
won't do us any good anyway.

166
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:17,998
I agree. The conditions they suggested
are favorable to us.

167
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:19,958
The Ministry of Unification
agrees as well,

168
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,128
but we can't just yield to their request
without trying to strike a deal.

169
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:27,966
How about we suggest a reunion
of the separated families as well?

170
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,844
I don't think we have anything to lose.

171
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:32,846
They'll try to strike a deal,

172
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,599
to take advantage of this opportunity
and make the most of it.

173
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:38,185
How will you take responsibility
for everything?

174
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,730
I have a plan.

175
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,026
-What's your plan?
-Pardon me?

176
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,283
The South sent me these documents
on the evidence they found.

177
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,410
Apparently, Cho Cheol Gang,
who defected to the South

178
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:58,663
after committing countless crimes and even
killing someone while being transported,

179
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:03,126
has been in contact with you
on a regular basis.

180
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:05,170
Did you give him the orders?

181
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,342
Of course not, sir.

182
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,179
Right?

183
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:18,141
You see, my son would never do
such a thing either.

184
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:22,437
He'd never betray his country
because of a woman.

185
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,860
Are you saying
we should cover up for each other?

186
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:30,195
Is that what it sounded like?

187
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:34,407
Fine.

188
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:37,285
On one condition, though.

189
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:41,164
The Military Department
will have full authority

190
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,501
over the entire repatriation process,
including where we'll receive them.

191
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,878
You wouldn't say no to that, right?

192
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:55,053
Hello.

193
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,846
-Nothing happened, right?
-Hello.

194
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,473
Let's go in.

195
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:03,853
Ms. Yoon.

196
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:06,523
How are you feeling?

197
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,735
-Good to see you.
-You look so weary.

198
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm okay now. Have a seat.

199
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:14,572
Okay.

200
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:24,457
When did you wake up?

201
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,126
A few minutes ago.

202
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,255
Would you please excuse us?

203
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:32,549
I have to talk to Se-ri about something.

204
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:33,842
-Sure.
-Sure.

205
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,305
Se-ri.

206
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:40,932
I just got a call.

207
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,104
He'll be sent back to the North.

208
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:56,740
When?

209
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,367
When will he leave?

210
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:02,120
Now.

211
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:10,420
Now?

212
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:14,466
Yes, he has to leave now.

213
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:21,598
Seeing you now pains me more

214
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:25,018
than the thought of
possibly ruining my entire life.

215
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,688
That's great news.

216
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,942
That's great.

217
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:36,363
I suppose

218
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,991
he didn't keep on lying.

219
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:42,952
The investigation must've gone well.

220
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:45,538
That's why he can return, right?

221
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:48,124
I'm so relieved.

222
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,382
Do you want to go see him?
Shall I take you to him?

223
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:07,060
I've said goodbye to him
a number of times already.

224
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:09,396
Too many times, in fact.

225
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,691
I no longer have anything else
to say to him.

226
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,363
And I don't want him
to see me like this...

227
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:23,451
because it'll only make it
more difficult for him to leave.

228
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,247
I don't even want him to know

229
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:29,958
that I suffered.

230
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:39,134
You think he didn't know?

231
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,680
He...

232
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,183
stayed by your side the whole time.

233
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:57,026
EMERGENCY OPERATING ROOM

234
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,708
<i>Even during</i>

235
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,502
<i>your long surgery...</i>

236
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,042
Why must we keep seeing her suffer?
It's so cruel.

237
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,084
Come on. Let's go.

238
00:17:57,462 --> 00:18:00,548
Honey, I think I should stay here
for a little longer.

239
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:02,050
What? Why?

240
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,135
She could wake up anytime.

241
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,804
I should stay by her side
because I'm her sister-in-law.

242
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,266
-I'll get mad at you.
-Hold on.

243
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,684
Come on. Let's go.

244
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,713
<i>Even while waiting for you
to regain your consciousness,</i>

245
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:46,594
<i>he stayed by your side
without eating or sleeping for days.</i>

246
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,104
-Ms. Yoon.
-Mother!

247
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,605
-Are you okay?
-She woke up.

248
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:58,982
Mother, she woke up.

249
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,444
Ms. Yoon.

250
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:05,697
Ms. Yoon.

251
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:49,449
WAITING ROOM

252
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,802
<i>He left the hospital after seeing you</i>

253
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,138
<i>regain your consciousness.</i>

254
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:25,068
Even if you said goodbye to him
multiple times,

255
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,738
you'll still miss him.

256
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,449
You really won't see him?

257
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,369
I want to see him.

258
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,372
Take me there.

259
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:38,831
Take me to him.

260
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,834
I really want to see him.

261
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,104
I have to say...

262
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,527
Thank goodness

263
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,278
that woman

264
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:11,406
woke up.

265
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:16,994
I know.

266
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:19,706
We had no idea

267
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,960
that Se-ri had collapsed
due to her illness.

268
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,841
How could you guys have known that?

269
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:33,636
After we leave,

270
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,639
we won't be able to find out
how she's doing,

271
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:42,103
so it's really good to hear
that she's regained her consciousness.

272
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:46,274
She'll be okay now.

273
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:58,161
Mr. Kim.

274
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:02,540
Did you bring all these cars
because we're leaving?

275
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:06,627
-That must've been a lot of work.
-Yes, it was a lot of work indeed.

276
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,008
We'll never come back here, right?

277
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:13,676
We shouldn't.

278
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,097
It's raining cats and dogs.

279
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:21,893
We won't need to come back here,

280
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,773
but I'll probably think about this place
from time to time.

281
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,492
Here we go. Hold tight.

282
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:05,436
Hello?

283
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:09,273
What?

284
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:14,278
No, we do have some time, but...

285
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,411
Where are you now?

286
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,051
INTER-KOREAN TRANSIT OFFICE

287
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,366
KAESONG

288
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,248
Is that the Military Demarcation Line?

289
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:11,544
Yes.

290
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:13,838
I think so.

291
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:18,759
So we'll be in the North
after we cross that line?

292
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:20,887
That's right.

293
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:24,891
All right. Let's get out now.

294
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:18,254
We still have about five minutes.

295
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:21,590
Why don't we have them cross the line
on the dot?

296
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:24,218
We have a long way to go,
so why waste time?

297
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:26,178
Let's do it now.

298
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:29,390
Okay.

299
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:37,106
We'll do that, then.

300
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:36,874
No. What are they doing?

301
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,001
Why...

302
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,129
Jeong Hyeok!

303
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:46,759
Don't run.

304
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:48,469
Jeong Hyeok!

305
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:52,139
You can't leave just like that.

306
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,516
I can't let them take you

307
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,559
-like that.
-Stop running!

308
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:57,686
What do I do
if you just leave me like that?

309
00:27:58,562 --> 00:28:01,982
How would I live
after you leave like that?

310
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,150
What should I do?

311
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,602
PEACE

312
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:49,780
You're not fully recovered yet.

313
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:52,074
What if you collapse again?

314
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:55,286
Can't you take better care of yourself?

315
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,330
Why are they putting handcuffs on you?

316
00:28:59,123 --> 00:29:00,249
Are you getting arrested?

317
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,420
No. I can't do that. I can't let you go.

318
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:06,881
Don't leave. Can't you stay here?

319
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:09,842
Don't worry.

320
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,262
Do you not know me?

321
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,306
Nothing will happen.

322
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:18,017
But why are they dragging you over?

323
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,644
What if something happens to you there?

324
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:22,813
It's all because of me.

325
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:25,399
It's all my fault.

326
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:30,029
Nothing will happen.

327
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:33,699
But even if

328
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:36,327
something happens,

329
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:40,789
it's not your fault.

330
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,918
I have no regrets.

331
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:47,838
You came into my life like a gift.

332
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:51,217
I'm just grateful for that.

333
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,013
Me too.

334
00:29:58,974 --> 00:30:01,310
Thank you, Jeong Hyeok.

335
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:07,107
I broke your heart with my word
the other day.

336
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,568
It broke my heart too.

337
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:13,197
I'm so sorry.

338
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,241
Please don't dwell on it.

339
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:16,992
It's okay.

340
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:20,704
I didn't mind it at all.

341
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:25,125
Don't worry about it.

342
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:28,212
So...

343
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,257
Can't we see each other again?

344
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,884
I will never get to see you again?

345
00:30:35,344 --> 00:30:36,470
Forever?

346
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:38,681
What do I do?

347
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:42,893
What should I do when I miss you so much?

348
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:53,529
Just wait

349
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:57,449
and pray desperately.

350
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:03,455
You asked if you can meet
someone you miss that way.

351
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,668
You can.

352
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:16,677
I love you.

353
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:23,642
I love you.

354
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:26,979
I really do.

355
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,623
Se-ri.

356
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:33,670
Take care.

357
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:35,714
Se-ri.

358
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,467
Stay healthy.

359
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:41,011
Take care.

360
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:46,725
Bye.

361
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:51,355
Take care, guys.

362
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:56,568
Don't get hurt.

363
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:25,431
PEACE

364
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:43,115
Really?

365
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:03,594
-What are you doing?
-Are you going to pick Jeong Hyeok up?

366
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:06,763
Make sure

367
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,600
to bring my son home alive.

368
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:11,518
Please.

369
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:13,395
Do you think Jeong Hyeok is only your son?

370
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:17,566
Whether something happens
to Jeong Hyeok or you,

371
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,610
I will get there right away.

372
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,528
Don't be weak

373
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:24,156
worrying about how I hold up on my own.

374
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,160
I'll see you later.

375
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:16,166
Why are we getting off here?

376
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,085
We were on our way to Pyongyang.

377
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:21,922
You will be executed
after the court-martial after all.

378
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:25,092
Wouldn't it be better to vanish here

379
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:28,387
before causing your family trouble?

380
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,349
Even if we end up dying,
we'd like to stand trial.

381
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,434
And the comrades behind me

382
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:37,479
just arrived late
after the Military World Games.

383
00:35:37,563 --> 00:35:38,772
They are not like me.

384
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:41,441
I'm the one who committed a crime.

385
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:45,946
It doesn't matter.

386
00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:49,992
We're just sending them with you,
so you won't be lonely on your way.

387
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,573
Military Director. Didn't I tell you?

388
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:34,661
You can't carry out an execution
without investigation and trial.

389
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:37,414
It might cause innocent victims.

390
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:44,129
But things are different

391
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:46,590
when I witnessed someone
trying to kill my son.

392
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:55,307
You can't be innocent.

393
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,767
Damn.

394
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,837
I'm sorry for making you worry.

395
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:28,882
I'm just glad you're back.

396
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:33,512
You came back alive.

397
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,180
So it's fine.

398
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:41,603
Is Yoon Se-ri all right?

399
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,731
Yes.

400
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:58,662
Are you crying?

401
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:24,771
Mother.

402
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:40,871
My dear son.

403
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,207
Thank you.

404
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,835
Thank you for coming back alive.

405
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:49,504
I'm glad that you're alive.

406
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:56,970
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

407
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:01,808
The roses of Sharon...

408
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:10,525
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

409
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:12,235
U Pil.

410
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:14,154
Dad!

411
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:16,782
U Pil.

412
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:20,827
Mom.

413
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:27,292
Man Bok.

414
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:33,006
I didn't hear a thing from you.

415
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:38,970
I thought you were dead.

416
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:43,391
Why did you not even give me a call?

417
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:49,105
I'm so sorry.

418
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,692
I'm sorry.

419
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:54,528
Thank you for coming back alive.

420
00:39:56,238 --> 00:39:58,114
Thank you for staying alive.

421
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,043
Failed again?

422
00:40:12,587 --> 00:40:14,464
What do we do?

423
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:19,594
We have to talk to her.
She might get seriously ill.

424
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:38,196
Please leave me alone.

425
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,784
Dan, just tell us.

426
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:47,414
What do you want your uncle
and me to do for you?

427
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:49,249
Nothing.

428
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,669
I don't want you to do anything.

429
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:57,549
Please leave me alone.

430
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:00,552
Why not?

431
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:09,185
Look at us.

432
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:12,272
We're here

433
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:14,900
to cry with you.

434
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:17,986
We can listen to you.

435
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,115
And we can go through
all the hard times with you.

436
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:36,963
Sure.

437
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:41,676
And I can get you a guy
who's a lot better than him.

438
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,973
Why?

439
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:48,224
Damn it.

440
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,521
Please get out.

441
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,403
Why...

442
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:04,282
Don't come near me.

443
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:06,242
-What's wrong?
-Why did you...

444
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:12,582
Why would you say that?

445
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:14,209
Have you lost your mind?

446
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:15,627
I was just...

447
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:18,505
Dan.

448
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:21,007
Why? Do you want to eat?

449
00:42:21,758 --> 00:42:23,635
-Mom.
-Yes.

450
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:25,762
-Uncle.
-Yes.

451
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,557
I want to get my revenge.

452
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:36,356
We're experts in that field.

453
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,191
Isn't that right?

454
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:40,068
Sure. We are.

455
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:43,905
I need you to find someone first.

456
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:56,042
About Gu Seung-jun...

457
00:42:57,669 --> 00:42:58,962
I'm sorry about that.

458
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:06,094
I heard some members of the gang

459
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:08,888
who sent the guys that day
are still in this country.

460
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:11,766
Right.

461
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:16,021
Don't worry about the consequences,
and just tell me where they are.

462
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:18,606
There's no way

463
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:21,568
they will leave this country alive.

464
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:25,780
And there must be people

465
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:28,408
who financed the gang.

466
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:30,660
Maybe...

467
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:33,580
Her second brother was quite greedy.

468
00:43:34,456 --> 00:43:36,833
And the easiest thing to do is

469
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:38,960
to tempt someone greedy.

470
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:42,547
It's Yoon Se-ri's second brother,

471
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:45,633
I guess.

472
00:43:50,972 --> 00:43:53,641
All right. Let me get this straight.

473
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:56,436
I never asked them
to capture Gu Seung-jun.

474
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,064
You did. Is that right?

475
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:02,025
And Gu Seung-jun happened to die
in the process.

476
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:04,861
That's what the people you hired did.

477
00:44:04,944 --> 00:44:08,281
It has nothing to do with me, right?

478
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:11,117
Will you say something?

479
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:13,703
When Manager Oh brought Cho Cheol Gang

480
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:16,664
and said all the crap
like capturing or killing Se-ri,

481
00:44:16,748 --> 00:44:19,250
I got furious and stormed out of the room.

482
00:44:19,334 --> 00:44:22,712
It's you who ordered Cho Cheol Gang
to take Se-ri.

483
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:23,755
You admit it, right?

484
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:36,184
Yoon Se-hyeong, you know nothing.

485
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:42,816
A recording without consent of the other
has no legal validity.

486
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:46,402
Does it even matter?
I'm just stating the facts.

487
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:48,321
Who would believe that?

488
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:52,075
I did the whole thing for you,
Yoon Se-hyeong.

489
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:55,662
For me? Don't give me that baloney.

490
00:44:55,745 --> 00:44:57,997
Think about the consequences
of what you've done for me.

491
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,457
I'm now

492
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,335
about to lose my position
as the president.

493
00:45:03,002 --> 00:45:07,298
If something goes wrong,
I might end up in jail because of you.

494
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:09,300
Calm yourself down.

495
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:11,636
It's North Korea
where Gu Seung-jun got killed.

496
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:15,223
Why would they want to deal with a case
that happened in North Korea?

497
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:17,892
I took care of things,
so the police won't find out

498
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:20,854
the money we wired and call history.

499
00:45:21,146 --> 00:45:25,066
Even Cho Cheol Gang
who tried to kidnap Se-ri

500
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:27,110
just died when we didn't do anything.

501
00:45:28,027 --> 00:45:30,196
We have nothing to worry about.

502
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:35,535
Are you sure about that?

503
00:45:44,252 --> 00:45:45,753
When did you get out of the hospital?

504
00:45:46,337 --> 00:45:47,297
Today.

505
00:45:48,256 --> 00:45:49,799
I got here as soon as I left.

506
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:51,843
Sit.

507
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:54,095
This isn't your house.
Don't tell me what to do.

508
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,059
When will you get questioned by NIS?

509
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:01,728
I did it already.

510
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:05,231
I think I'll be prosecuted.

511
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:09,068
It's about the violation
of the National Security Act.

512
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:10,778
You should get a good attorney.

513
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:14,532
Don't worry. She will have my attorney.

514
00:46:15,116 --> 00:46:17,118
She might be accused
of misprision of felony.

515
00:46:17,202 --> 00:46:20,205
But there were extenuating circumstances,

516
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:23,958
so she will be given
a suspended sentence or a fine.

517
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:27,837
Still, it's not a minor crime.

518
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:29,839
What if there's an article about her?

519
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:33,301
Mind your own business. There will be
more than a probation for you two.

520
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:36,971
-What?
-If you knew about the law that well,

521
00:46:37,513 --> 00:46:39,682
you should've been more cautious.

522
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:43,895
Knowing someone is a criminal
or about to commit a crime,

523
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,899
if you offer money
or other pecuniary advantage

524
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:51,319
or provide a place
for communication, stakeout, or contact,

525
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:54,614
you shall be sentenced to a penalty
of up to ten years in prison.

526
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:56,950
What are you talking about?

527
00:46:57,492 --> 00:46:58,701
Come on out.

528
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,919
I brought them from NIS.

529
00:47:08,127 --> 00:47:09,420
I'm sorry.

530
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:11,923
There's a broker named Cheon

531
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:14,467
who used to take care of Gu Seung-jun.

532
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:16,761
He sent all the account details

533
00:47:16,844 --> 00:47:19,847
and phone call recordings

534
00:47:20,056 --> 00:47:22,475
to Ms. Yoon through China.

535
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:28,523
I just did what these two told me to do.

536
00:47:28,606 --> 00:47:31,609
What are you talking about?
Who told you to do that, you idiot?

537
00:47:31,693 --> 00:47:35,905
Hey. How dare you
try to put the blame on us?

538
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,283
I guess you two have a lot to talk about.

539
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:41,536
This case is solicitation of murder,
solicitation of kidnap,

540
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:42,829
and concealment of an offender.

541
00:47:42,912 --> 00:47:46,249
There are a lot of charges.

542
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:49,502
The police and NIS will need
a joint investigation.

543
00:47:49,669 --> 00:47:51,045
Anyway,

544
00:47:53,214 --> 00:47:54,132
come with us.

545
00:47:56,342 --> 00:47:57,760
You said it will be okay.

546
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:00,596
Go ahead and do something.

547
00:48:05,852 --> 00:48:06,686
Dad.

548
00:48:08,271 --> 00:48:11,024
Are you going to sit back
and watch me get arrested?

549
00:48:11,107 --> 00:48:14,485
You should think
about the image of our company.

550
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:15,611
Shut your mouth.

551
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,906
So you are a businessman.

552
00:48:19,741 --> 00:48:20,825
Do you still not get it?

553
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:23,411
That I'm cutting you off?

554
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:28,166
I'm cutting out the rotten part
before it gets serious.

555
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,913
HOW TO MAKE SCORCHED RICE
HOW TO COOK NOODLES

556
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:42,675
<i>Are you still up?</i>

557
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:48,306
<i>If you're reading my message now,
it means you're still awake.</i>

558
00:50:50,183 --> 00:50:53,019
Jeong Hyeok, how...

559
00:51:03,029 --> 00:51:04,197
Click Message.

560
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:08,284
Pick a date and time you want.

561
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:09,702
Done.

562
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:14,040
Write a message.

563
00:51:15,249 --> 00:51:16,584
Give it a try.

564
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:31,933
<i>I still worry a lot about you.</i>

565
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:35,353
<i>And I have a lot of things left
to tell you.</i>

566
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:39,524
<i>So I'm sending these messages
to tell you all of them.</i>

567
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:45,905
<i>What I want to tell you the most
is on your bookshelf.</i>

568
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:52,245
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

569
00:51:52,328 --> 00:51:55,748
<i>It's my reply to the message
you sent me before.</i>

570
00:51:59,669 --> 00:52:01,420
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

571
00:52:01,504 --> 00:52:02,630
What?

572
00:52:04,215 --> 00:52:05,841
Is he a little kid or what?

573
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:10,388
He just copies all sorts of stuff.

574
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:13,474
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

575
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:17,353
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

576
00:52:30,908 --> 00:52:32,243
<i>Good morning.</i>

577
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,204
<i>Don't go to work on an empty stomach.</i>

578
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:37,373
<i>Make sure to eat at least an apple.</i>

579
00:52:51,637 --> 00:52:53,472
<i>Just so you know,</i>

580
00:52:53,973 --> 00:52:57,059
<i>it's good that you stick to your lane,</i>

581
00:52:57,143 --> 00:53:00,521
<i>but you shouldn't look only forwards.
You should look aside from time to time.</i>

582
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,172
<i>Eat regularly at scheduled times.</i>

583
00:53:26,797 --> 00:53:30,760
<i>And don't eat alone.
Enjoy your meals with other people.</i>

584
00:53:31,302 --> 00:53:32,386
<i>With relish.</i>

585
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:38,309
So did you check the meat
as soon as you got here?

586
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:41,228
Did you see that
at the entrance to the town?

587
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:43,981
The way women looked at me...

588
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:45,066
I didn't see it.

589
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,946
<i>Why don't you take a walk
for 30 minutes from 12:30 p.m.?</i>

590
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:54,659
<i>I'll make sure
to go for a walk at that hour.</i>

591
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:04,210
It's good to have a walk.

592
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:06,128
Jeong Hyeok.

593
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:08,589
It's good to have a walk.

594
00:54:11,425 --> 00:54:12,468
Se-ri.

595
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:21,894
Potato is good...

596
00:54:24,146 --> 00:54:25,564
as FF.

597
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:27,400
What?

598
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,320
Do you not know FF? The fried potato.

599
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:33,447
What was the name again?

600
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:35,825
-You mean French fries?
-Exactly.

601
00:54:35,908 --> 00:54:39,578
It's totally COMI.

602
00:54:39,662 --> 00:54:42,248
What does that mean?

603
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:45,000
Do you not know what COMI means?

604
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:49,255
It's crispy on the outside
and moist on the inside.

605
00:54:52,007 --> 00:54:53,884
It's no big deal.

606
00:54:54,635 --> 00:54:57,596
You just sound like a Seoul citizen.

607
00:54:59,473 --> 00:55:00,725
It actually suits me well.

608
00:55:02,977 --> 00:55:06,105
Actually, I turned on the faucet
and waited to get

609
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:08,774
hot water this morning.

610
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,193
So I was kind of surprised.

611
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:14,363
I also waited
to get electricity for a while.

612
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:15,614
I know.

613
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:18,409
There has always been no electricity here.

614
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:21,078
I can put up with all that.

615
00:55:22,163 --> 00:55:25,541
But it's frustrating
that there's no Internet connection here.

616
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,711
It's feels like new hell.

617
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:30,713
When I lie down at night,

618
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:35,050
I see the video game screens
on the ceiling.

619
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:51,567
Hello everyone.

620
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,570
Gosh, look who's here.

621
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:56,238
Hello, Mrs. Go.

622
00:55:56,322 --> 00:55:58,574
It's been a long time.

623
00:55:58,657 --> 00:56:00,451
What brings you here?

624
00:56:00,534 --> 00:56:05,664
Dan is moving out
of her matrimonial home today.

625
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:10,336
No, it's okay. Don't be like that.

626
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:14,089
I feel so good and lighthearted.

627
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:16,342
It's chilly out here.

628
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:17,635
Why don't we go inside?

629
00:56:17,718 --> 00:56:19,136
Shall we?

630
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,015
I recently went to Europe.

631
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,100
-Europe?
-My gosh.

632
00:56:25,184 --> 00:56:26,769
I see.

633
00:56:26,852 --> 00:56:29,897
And I found some

634
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,776
limited-edition products
you'd love a lot there,

635
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:35,861
so I bought them.

636
00:56:35,986 --> 00:56:36,987
You bought them?

637
00:56:42,451 --> 00:56:43,452
Yeong, Wol?

638
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:45,788
Myeong, Ok?

639
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:49,792
I think it looks

640
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:52,336
like me somehow.

641
00:56:52,419 --> 00:56:55,422
And this is how I looked
when I got married.

642
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:57,633
This is no better than my actual face,

643
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,386
but I'm sure it is me.

644
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:01,887
-I looks the same.
-I know.

645
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:05,516
-What is going on?
-My gosh.

646
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,893
They are the new products

647
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:10,938
from Se-ri's Choice for this spring.

648
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:13,732
-Se-ri's Choice?
-Are you serious?

649
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:16,235
Does it mean Se-ri did this for us...

650
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:17,570
I know.

651
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:19,738
My gosh.

652
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:23,492
I said you don't have to
be like this around me.

653
00:57:23,576 --> 00:57:26,787
I don't have any grudge against the lady

654
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:27,913
from down South.

655
00:57:27,997 --> 00:57:30,124
I can't kill my enemy

656
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:32,418
when she doesn't come
under my observation.

657
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:35,254
I can't even see her now.

658
00:57:35,337 --> 00:57:37,006
So I have no grudge.

659
00:57:38,257 --> 00:57:40,926
She wasn't here for a long time,
but she didn't forget us

660
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:43,596
and made things like this for you guys.

661
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:47,099
I don't think she's an ill-mannered lady.

662
00:57:47,182 --> 00:57:48,392
I know.

663
00:57:48,475 --> 00:57:49,810
She's not ill-mannered.

664
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:52,062
She's really good at heart.

665
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:55,274
The name of the limited line products

666
00:57:55,357 --> 00:57:57,568
of Se-ri's Choice for this season

667
00:57:58,819 --> 00:58:01,780
is saudade.

668
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:03,824
It says saudade here.

669
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,075
SAUDADE

670
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:06,869
What do we do?

671
00:58:06,952 --> 00:58:08,203
What should we do?

672
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:10,956
Gosh, I can't believe this.

673
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,377
YEONG

674
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:17,296
Does it say Yeong?

675
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:18,422
Yes.

676
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:21,050
And this is Wol as in Wol Suk.

677
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:23,177
It says Myeong as in Myeong Sun.

678
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,471
And this is Ok as in Ok Geum.

679
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,767
So she got there safely.

680
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:32,561
I guess she's doing fine.

681
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:36,398
Apparently, she didn't forget us.

682
00:58:37,608 --> 00:58:39,151
I wish

683
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,362
I could tell her

684
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:43,572
that we got these

685
00:58:43,948 --> 00:58:46,200
and we will use them well.

686
00:58:46,408 --> 00:58:47,952
Where should I say that to?

687
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:51,080
I believe she will know how we feel.

688
00:58:51,747 --> 00:58:53,040
I hope so.

689
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,548
Do you see something over there?

690
00:59:01,632 --> 00:59:02,800
No.

691
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,929
I'm tearing up because of the light
from the sky.

692
00:59:30,244 --> 00:59:31,870
What are you looking at?

693
00:59:32,538 --> 00:59:33,539
Aren't you coming down?

694
00:59:33,622 --> 00:59:35,582
No. I'll be right there.

695
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:38,168
Give me ten minutes.
No, only five minutes.

696
00:59:38,252 --> 00:59:39,169
You have three minutes.

697
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,048
What should I wear?

698
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:52,725
Three minutes were too short.

699
00:59:53,392 --> 00:59:54,893
Do you like my clothes?

700
00:59:54,977 --> 00:59:56,854
I tried to look good.

701
00:59:58,897 --> 00:59:59,940
Well...

702
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:04,236
I mean, this is our first date.

703
01:00:05,237 --> 01:00:06,405
It's not a date.

704
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:08,699
The weather is so nice.

705
01:00:10,951 --> 01:00:12,953
-It's not so good.
-I like it, though.

706
01:00:16,248 --> 01:00:19,168
How does this place look
when flowers blossom?

707
01:00:19,585 --> 01:00:20,544
Well...

708
01:00:20,794 --> 01:00:21,962
I guess it's not bad.

709
01:00:22,046 --> 01:00:23,297
I see.

710
01:00:24,131 --> 01:00:27,968
I should come back here with you
when flowers blossom.

711
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:31,221
I didn't say I'd do that.

712
01:00:31,805 --> 01:00:35,142
I'll be happy if you do.

713
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:44,193
<i>As spring wind blows</i>

714
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:48,405
<i>Scattering cherry blossom petals</i>

715
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:33,450
<i>First of all,</i>

716
01:01:34,118 --> 01:01:35,202
<i>you're pretty.</i>

717
01:01:36,203 --> 01:01:38,122
And you make me want to become

718
01:01:38,956 --> 01:01:40,707
a better man.

719
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:44,086
You're so amazing
that you make me feel that way.

720
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:46,922
You are an amazing woman.

721
01:02:28,964 --> 01:02:30,257
I was thinking

722
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:34,428
we should get together sometime.

723
01:02:34,761 --> 01:02:37,264
Thank you for coming all the way.

724
01:02:37,347 --> 01:02:39,683
I don't know what to say.

725
01:02:40,517 --> 01:02:41,727
It's okay.

726
01:02:42,352 --> 01:02:46,023
I had to come because
I'm the one who has something to say.

727
01:02:52,946 --> 01:02:55,449
Why are you doing this?

728
01:02:56,825 --> 01:03:00,412
I'm going to tell you
something I feel sorry about.

729
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:03,081
So I apologized in advance.

730
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:13,967
I'm afraid my daughter is not meant
to be with your son.

731
01:03:16,678 --> 01:03:17,804
Is it

732
01:03:19,223 --> 01:03:22,059
because you heard something about us?

733
01:03:23,477 --> 01:03:26,939
We wouldn't need other reasons.

734
01:03:29,942 --> 01:03:31,151
Dan says

735
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:35,781
she doesn't want to marry Jeong Hyeok.

736
01:03:36,365 --> 01:03:40,410
I feel bad for her for spending
the past ten years on him, but...

737
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:42,079
I am

738
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,208
heartily sorry for that.

739
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:49,503
Please don't be.
You don't have to apologize.

740
01:03:49,711 --> 01:03:52,506
I'm the one who should apologize.

741
01:03:53,632 --> 01:03:57,261
Jeong Hyuk got transferred
without telling his fiancée.

742
01:03:58,011 --> 01:04:00,138
And his parents didn't say anything

743
01:04:00,222 --> 01:04:03,058
other than that the wedding is postponed.

744
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:06,395
I was upset back then.

745
01:04:06,895 --> 01:04:09,147
I wanted you to apologize to me.

746
01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:12,818
But things are different now.

747
01:04:13,986 --> 01:04:15,988
I'm breaking off

748
01:04:16,822 --> 01:04:20,867
this engagement
because my daughter doesn't want it.

749
01:04:22,202 --> 01:04:24,246
I should apologize.

750
01:04:25,664 --> 01:04:28,041
We weren't being considerate.

751
01:04:29,626 --> 01:04:32,087
There were complicated circumstances,

752
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:34,464
but we didn't have a chance to explain...

753
01:04:34,548 --> 01:04:38,885
I will explain our circumstances.

754
01:04:40,095 --> 01:04:41,388
Dan

755
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:44,433
has someone she loves.

756
01:04:46,643 --> 01:04:49,313
And the guy loves Dan...

757
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:55,861
even more

758
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:58,113
than his own life.

759
01:05:02,743 --> 01:05:04,328
So I have no choice.

760
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:07,080
We only live once.

761
01:05:07,622 --> 01:05:09,791
And they love each other
more than their lives.

762
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,127
There's nothing I can do about it.

763
01:05:17,132 --> 01:05:18,592
You are right.

764
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,011
I agree with you.

765
01:05:22,512 --> 01:05:23,764
Do you?

766
01:05:24,931 --> 01:05:25,974
Yes.

767
01:05:28,769 --> 01:05:30,145
Mrs. Go.

768
01:05:31,438 --> 01:05:32,939
I'm truly sorry.

769
01:05:33,607 --> 01:05:34,941
And thank you.

770
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:09,406
I said I would come
to see you this weekend.

771
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,533
Right.

772
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:13,410
I know that.

773
01:06:13,994 --> 01:06:18,457
But I wanted to come here again.

774
01:06:19,124 --> 01:06:20,876
I once came to this house

775
01:06:22,002 --> 01:06:23,378
while you were gone.

776
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:26,131
To my house?

777
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:35,849
I know a man like me

778
01:06:36,516 --> 01:06:38,560
should not do this

779
01:06:40,353 --> 01:06:43,398
to a woman like you, Dan.

780
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,487
Still,

781
01:06:50,113 --> 01:06:51,406
I wanted to give it to you.

782
01:07:12,052 --> 01:07:14,429
I came here with Seung-jun.

783
01:07:15,013 --> 01:07:16,181
I see.

784
01:07:17,557 --> 01:07:19,893
He helped me a lot.

785
01:07:20,852 --> 01:07:22,270
Where is he now?

786
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:23,730
I couldn't reach him.

787
01:07:25,273 --> 01:07:26,733
He went far away.

788
01:07:28,276 --> 01:07:30,320
He will never come back.

789
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:34,282
But why...

790
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,326
I don't know.

791
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:40,372
I don't know the reason.

792
01:07:41,289 --> 01:07:43,917
A lot of things happen in life.

793
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:48,213
And we can't explain
why most of them happen.

794
01:07:49,256 --> 01:07:52,843
When I went to Switzerland to see you,

795
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:58,181
I didn't know the reason back then.

796
01:07:59,182 --> 01:08:01,101
The reason you kept taking pictures

797
01:08:01,393 --> 01:08:02,978
of the scenery

798
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:06,231
when I'm gone all the way there
to see you.

799
01:08:12,195 --> 01:08:13,488
Shall we get some coffee...

800
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,466
Excuse me. I think that's my seat.

801
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:15,425
<i>But the night when I came to this house,</i>

802
01:09:17,135 --> 01:09:19,721
I could finally understand why.

803
01:09:29,272 --> 01:09:30,398
That's...

804
01:09:31,316 --> 01:09:34,736
I was looking for a candle that night
and found this by accident.

805
01:09:35,403 --> 01:09:38,615
I hated seeing that camera
in Switzerland so much

806
01:09:39,032 --> 01:09:40,659
that I recognized it immediately.

807
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:44,162
I took it with me
so that I could throw it away.

808
01:09:44,955 --> 01:09:47,707
After all, I had been your fiancée
for the past ten years.

809
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,293
I thought I had the right to do so.

810
01:09:55,215 --> 01:09:57,592
This is very old, so I'm sure it's broken.

811
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:59,552
I got it fixed.

812
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,555
And I finally found it.

813
01:10:03,556 --> 01:10:04,599
Found what?

814
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:09,312
The reason...

815
01:10:11,064 --> 01:10:13,233
you refused to look at me
back in Switzerland.

816
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:20,907
I guess

817
01:10:21,866 --> 01:10:24,119
this was meant to be.

818
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:33,855
Don't live too happily, though.

819
01:12:12,977 --> 01:12:14,938
<i>Today is the Mangzhong season.</i>

820
01:12:15,355 --> 01:12:16,689
<i>It's the day we plant seeds.</i>

821
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,567
What? <i>Mangzhong</i>?

822
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:22,362
Was he a farmer in his past life?

823
01:12:23,196 --> 01:12:26,241
Gosh, Jeong Hyeok.

824
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:31,079
<i>So you'll be getting</i>

825
01:12:31,538 --> 01:12:33,790
<i>a flower pot.</i>

826
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,628
-What is this?
-<i>You'll know what it is</i>

827
01:12:39,003 --> 01:12:40,672
<i>after you grow it.</i>

828
01:12:41,339 --> 01:12:43,591
<i>It may be sensitive and fussy,</i>

829
01:12:43,675 --> 01:12:45,677
<i>but if you do as you're told,</i>

830
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:49,139
<i>it'll sprout after two weeks.</i>

831
01:12:51,224 --> 01:12:53,059
<i>You need to water it.</i>

832
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:56,604
<i>But since it's sensitive to humidity,
don't give it too much water.</i>

833
01:12:56,688 --> 01:12:59,232
-<i>Give it moderate amount of water.</i>
-How much

834
01:13:00,191 --> 01:13:01,401
is "moderate"?

835
01:13:03,987 --> 01:13:05,029
Is this enough?

836
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:07,740
<i>It needs sunlight as well.</i>

837
01:13:08,366 --> 01:13:10,743
<i>But don't put it under the sun
for too long.</i>

838
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:13,079
<i>Keep it under the sun
for a moderate amount of time.</i>

839
01:13:18,793 --> 01:13:22,922
<i>And lastly, this is the most
important part when growing plants.</i>

840
01:13:23,923 --> 01:13:26,176
<i>You probably know well.</i>

841
01:13:27,343 --> 01:13:29,304
<i>Say ten nice things to it every day.</i>

842
01:13:31,514 --> 01:13:33,516
This is so much work.

843
01:13:38,938 --> 01:13:41,524
Ms. Sold Out, upper price limit,
stock option,

844
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:44,861
legendary sales, excellent brand,
high return,

845
01:13:44,944 --> 01:13:48,198
going public on the KOSDAQ,
the best in the field, limited-edition,

846
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:51,534
and Ri Jeong Hyeok.

847
01:14:00,793 --> 01:14:01,878
What?

848
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,948
Oh, thank you.

849
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,288
How's Chairwoman Yoon doing?

850
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:39,541
She's a bit strange.

851
01:14:39,749 --> 01:14:41,751
She's strange in a different way
this time.

852
01:14:42,418 --> 01:14:43,711
What is it now?

853
01:14:46,673 --> 01:14:48,049
She's a bit...

854
01:14:54,347 --> 01:14:55,640
<i>excited.</i>

855
01:15:01,813 --> 01:15:03,147
<i>In between working,</i>

856
01:15:03,231 --> 01:15:05,400
<i>make sure to stretch and exercise.</i>

857
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:11,281
Let's talk about that
after the business trip next week.

858
01:15:11,364 --> 01:15:12,657
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

859
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,159
As you all know, we've collaborated

860
01:15:15,243 --> 01:15:18,746
with a famous e-commerce company in China
for our upcoming products.

861
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,833
We've incorporated
the new design patterns.

862
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,586
This is from the first batch of samples.

863
01:15:24,669 --> 01:15:26,754
We'll be modifying them

864
01:15:26,838 --> 01:15:28,548
according to what you say,

865
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:30,258
so please share your opinions with us.

866
01:15:30,341 --> 01:15:31,676
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

867
01:15:31,759 --> 01:15:35,305
<i>She'd get upset at the slightest noise
when having a meeting.</i>

868
01:15:35,555 --> 01:15:37,932
<i>She was the most sensitive person ever.
However...</i>

869
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:46,190
I'm sorry.

870
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:51,029
That's Chopin.

871
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,407
I like his music too.

872
01:15:55,325 --> 01:15:57,994
My favorite one is "Nocturne."

873
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:01,372
You should take that call.

874
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:03,791
Thanks to her,
the rest of us can take a break as well.

875
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:07,420
-Right. Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

876
01:16:14,427 --> 01:16:16,471
<i>I like Chopin.</i>

877
01:16:16,554 --> 01:16:18,598
<i>I especially like "Nocturne."</i>

878
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:20,600
<i>Seasons changed,</i>

879
01:16:21,142 --> 01:16:23,269
<i>but his messages kept coming.</i>

880
01:16:24,854 --> 01:16:26,397
<i>Today is Malbok.</i>

881
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:30,276
Thanks to you, I'll become

882
01:16:30,777 --> 01:16:32,570
a lunar calendar expert.

883
01:16:32,779 --> 01:16:35,156
<i>Appreciate the flowers that bloom
during each season.</i>

884
01:16:35,406 --> 01:16:38,159
<i>Eat the dishes that are best
during each season.</i>

885
01:16:44,123 --> 01:16:46,209
All right. It's <i>Malbok</i> today,

886
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:47,960
so enjoy the chicken

887
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:49,587
and go home early.

888
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:54,759
<i>I hope you won't miss the small happiness</i>

889
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,554
<i>that you can and must find
in your everyday life.</i>

890
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,724
<i>We've never welcomed spring</i>

891
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:05,645
<i>or sweated during the summertime together.</i>

892
01:17:06,062 --> 01:17:07,313
<i>But thanks to his messages</i>

893
01:17:07,897 --> 01:17:10,566
<i>that came like presents
every few days or so,</i>

894
01:17:11,109 --> 01:17:15,029
<i>it felt like we were spending
every season together.</i>

895
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:19,283
<i>I was afraid he'd feel sad if I were.</i>

896
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:23,621
<i>So I tried my best to laugh, be thankful,</i>

897
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:26,791
<i>and be happy.</i>

898
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:46,644
<i>Since it's 12 a.m.,
it must be your birthday.</i>

899
01:17:47,228 --> 01:17:48,521
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

900
01:17:49,814 --> 01:17:51,023
Thank you.

901
01:17:51,816 --> 01:17:54,610
<i>I'm afraid this will be my last message.</i>

902
01:17:55,361 --> 01:17:58,072
<i>Apparently, reserved messages
have a one-year limit.</i>

903
01:17:58,448 --> 01:18:01,200
<i>And I must go now.</i>

904
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:03,745
Really?

905
01:18:04,328 --> 01:18:06,581
<i>I wonder if the flowers have bloomed.</i>

906
01:18:11,043 --> 01:18:12,044
They have.

907
01:18:12,879 --> 01:18:14,338
<i>They're edelweiss.</i>

908
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:18,760
I know.

909
01:18:20,011 --> 01:18:23,848
<i>Let's meet in the country
where those flowers bloom.</i>

910
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:27,226
<i>I cannot tell you the exact date.</i>

911
01:18:28,728 --> 01:18:29,687
<i>But</i>

912
01:18:30,855 --> 01:18:32,398
<i>if we both</i>

913
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:34,150
<i>try our best,</i>

914
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:37,403
<i>perhaps, fate will be on our side.</i>

915
01:18:38,029 --> 01:18:39,655
What is this?

916
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:42,742
He's so vague.

917
01:18:48,748 --> 01:18:50,124
Hello, Yeong Ae.

918
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:53,461
-They're warm.
-Hello, there.

919
01:18:53,544 --> 01:18:55,338
-Buy some tofu.
-Could you give me one?

920
01:18:55,421 --> 01:18:57,298
Sure. Here.

921
01:18:57,381 --> 01:18:58,382
Let's go.

922
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:00,259
<i>-How far have you gone?
-How far have you gone?</i>

923
01:19:00,343 --> 01:19:02,220
<i>-I'm at the village.
-I'm at the village.</i>

924
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:04,263
<i>-How far have you gone?</i>
-Here you go.

925
01:19:04,347 --> 01:19:05,473
I'd like one too.

926
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:08,100
-Okay. Here you go.
-Thank you.

927
01:19:08,184 --> 01:19:09,393
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

928
01:19:09,477 --> 01:19:10,603
I hope business will thrive.

929
01:19:10,686 --> 01:19:11,854
Goodbye.

930
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:19,237
Right, is it today?

931
01:19:19,403 --> 01:19:21,113
Yes, it is.

932
01:19:22,573 --> 01:19:24,617
I can't believe it's been two months.

933
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,079
I feel this way every time,
but it's been ages.

934
01:19:28,162 --> 01:19:30,248
I agree.

935
01:19:30,331 --> 01:19:33,709
Every time I feel Jeong Hyeok's absence
in this village,

936
01:19:33,793 --> 01:19:35,753
I have a great urge

937
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,172
to send my husband,
who's doing nothing at home,

938
01:19:38,256 --> 01:19:40,007
to the outpost instead.

939
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:42,844
You read my mind.

940
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:45,805
All right, then. Shall we boil the eggs?

941
01:19:45,888 --> 01:19:47,598
Of course.

942
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:49,892
I'll cook the dishes myself.

943
01:19:50,643 --> 01:19:52,937
And I'll fill his crocks like always.

944
01:19:53,521 --> 01:19:57,066
Great. Let's get to work
and meet in the afternoon.

945
01:20:15,543 --> 01:20:16,919
Aren't you cold?

946
01:20:17,003 --> 01:20:18,588
No, I'm not.

947
01:20:18,671 --> 01:20:20,131
I guess you didn't know.

948
01:20:20,214 --> 01:20:22,842
I naturally have a lot of heat in my body,

949
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:25,177
so I don't feel cold at all.

950
01:20:26,012 --> 01:20:27,847
Hey, guys.

951
01:20:29,557 --> 01:20:30,725
What is it?

952
01:20:30,808 --> 01:20:32,727
Are your lips on fire?

953
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:34,437
Oh, this?

954
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:36,981
I paid a hefty sum to buy this
from the market.

955
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:39,817
It's from the South.

956
01:20:40,318 --> 01:20:43,070
The name of this product is
"Lips that Bring about Spring."

957
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:44,780
I beg to differ.

958
01:20:45,072 --> 01:20:47,783
I bet the anchovies will think
that it's <i>chojang</i> and charge at you.

959
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:49,535
What did you just say?

960
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:53,289
If you're all here,
why aren't you working?

961
01:20:53,372 --> 01:20:55,416
My, spin around.

962
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:00,671
-Goodness, Yeong Ae!
-You look pretty.

963
01:21:01,881 --> 01:21:04,508
I'm just happy because spring is coming.

964
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:05,676
Wow.

965
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,096
Besides, I naturally have a lot of heat
in my body.

966
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,474
-I see.
-I see.

967
01:21:16,854 --> 01:21:19,523
It's the spring breeze. Let's go inside.

968
01:21:19,607 --> 01:21:20,858
-Shall we?
-But I thought you had

969
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:22,818
-It's the spring breeze.
-a lot of heat.

970
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,823
It really feels nice to be here together.

971
01:21:27,907 --> 01:21:32,370
As the head of this village,
I should've done this earlier.

972
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:35,247
I promise to do this more often
in the future.

973
01:21:35,331 --> 01:21:36,165
Right.

974
01:21:36,248 --> 01:21:37,959
Thank you.

975
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:41,253
I'd appreciate it if you showed that much
hospitality to the new captain as well.

976
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:43,547
Of course, don't you worry...

977
01:21:44,715 --> 01:21:45,716
What?

978
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:47,635
What did you say?

979
01:21:49,303 --> 01:21:51,138
I have been discharged by my superiors

980
01:21:51,222 --> 01:21:54,308
and chosen as the pianist
for the National Symphony Orchestra.

981
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:56,519
-Gosh, my blood pressure...
-Oh, dear.

982
01:21:56,602 --> 01:21:59,605
-What's wrong with me?
-Out of the blue?

983
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:03,150
-Yes.
-This is too sudden.

984
01:22:03,234 --> 01:22:05,611
We're going to miss you terribly.

985
01:22:06,654 --> 01:22:08,739
The new captain will be living here,

986
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:10,491
so please help him out.

987
01:22:11,409 --> 01:22:12,410
Goodness.

988
01:22:12,702 --> 01:22:14,954
Then

989
01:22:15,037 --> 01:22:17,623
who's the new captain?

990
01:22:23,087 --> 01:22:25,965
-I see.
-It's him.

991
01:22:26,298 --> 01:22:28,759
No, it's not him.

992
01:22:29,343 --> 01:22:31,512
It's him. Over there.

993
01:22:33,222 --> 01:22:34,598
What?

994
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:36,559
-I see.
-I see.

995
01:22:39,603 --> 01:22:41,022
Are you talking about him?

996
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,648
Yes.

997
01:22:43,983 --> 01:22:45,109
Hello.

998
01:22:45,192 --> 01:22:47,319
My name is Pyo Chi Su.

999
01:22:47,987 --> 01:22:50,239
I heard the villagers are so generous

1000
01:22:50,322 --> 01:22:54,201
that the crocks are always filled
with meat.

1001
01:22:54,493 --> 01:22:56,662
I do look forward to living here.

1002
01:22:59,832 --> 01:23:03,002
That's actually a false rumor.

1003
01:23:03,085 --> 01:23:07,048
And our villagers
aren't that generous either.

1004
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:10,384
To be honest, we're quite stingy.

1005
01:23:10,468 --> 01:23:11,510
You're right.

1006
01:23:11,594 --> 01:23:16,057
We're not the type to be
overly friendly with others.

1007
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,017
-We're not like that.
-No, we're not.

1008
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,895
You won't be able to help it.

1009
01:23:21,771 --> 01:23:23,022
I see.

1010
01:23:28,402 --> 01:23:30,237
If you leave like this,

1011
01:23:30,446 --> 01:23:32,698
when will we be able to meet again?

1012
01:23:33,115 --> 01:23:34,700
I'm sure we'll meet once again.

1013
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,619
If I get to perform once again,

1014
01:23:36,702 --> 01:23:39,080
I'll invite you all to Pyongyang.

1015
01:23:52,968 --> 01:23:54,303
Let's eat.

1016
01:23:54,887 --> 01:23:57,264
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

1017
01:23:57,348 --> 01:23:59,016
Thank you for the meal.

1018
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,893
Thank you for the meal.

1019
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:02,478
Eat up. Here.

1020
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:04,939
Give us the meat dish.

1021
01:24:05,022 --> 01:24:05,898
Here.

1022
01:24:06,649 --> 01:24:08,400
Here you go.

1023
01:24:11,487 --> 01:24:13,155
Put that here.

1024
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:15,074
Here.

1025
01:24:15,741 --> 01:24:17,868
-Eat up.
-You too.

1026
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,457
-Right?
-Yes.

1027
01:24:26,043 --> 01:24:28,045
I haven't seen my husband
for quite a while.

1028
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:29,797
Where the heck is he?

1029
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:49,191
Have some.

1030
01:25:18,979 --> 01:25:21,315
Goodness, I can't believe it.

1031
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:23,025
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, honey.

1032
01:25:23,109 --> 01:25:24,193
-Hi.
-Hey.

1033
01:25:25,069 --> 01:25:29,115
I'm sorry. I spent all day playing golf.

1034
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:31,367
You weren't just playing golf.

1035
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,411
It's all part of your business.

1036
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:35,996
You're the best.

1037
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:41,127
It's the best choice you've made
in your lifetime.

1038
01:25:41,419 --> 01:25:42,670
What?

1039
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,213
Playing golf?

1040
01:25:44,296 --> 01:25:45,339
No.

1041
01:25:45,756 --> 01:25:48,551
Agreeing to leave the business
in the hands of a professional manager.

1042
01:25:48,634 --> 01:25:51,137
Look at how great the company is doing.

1043
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,972
Are you being sarcastic?

1044
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,140
No way.

1045
01:25:55,141 --> 01:25:57,226
Mom, you should tell her that

1046
01:25:57,309 --> 01:25:59,103
a professional manager
may manage our company,

1047
01:25:59,186 --> 01:26:01,105
but I'm taking care of many things.

1048
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:03,691
I have to look into everything,

1049
01:26:03,774 --> 01:26:05,985
give orders, and confirm things.

1050
01:26:06,068 --> 01:26:08,237
Without me, this company would crumble.
Do you know that?

1051
01:26:08,988 --> 01:26:10,072
Really?

1052
01:26:10,406 --> 01:26:11,740
Yes, I'm telling you.

1053
01:26:15,035 --> 01:26:16,162
If that's the case,

1054
01:26:16,912 --> 01:26:20,291
may I suggest something?

1055
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:24,795
It's the most ideal business
if we want to reform our company.

1056
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:29,842
Let me hear it first. Tell me.

1057
01:26:30,509 --> 01:26:33,762
Never mind. You don't have
any power anyway.

1058
01:26:33,846 --> 01:26:35,347
Forget about it.

1059
01:26:35,848 --> 01:26:38,017
What are you talking about?

1060
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,604
Mom, say something. I guess you won't.

1061
01:26:41,687 --> 01:26:45,149
Look at the shares we have.
We have quite a lot.

1062
01:26:45,232 --> 01:26:46,817
On top of that, I'm the eldest son.

1063
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,195
So why don't I have any power?

1064
01:26:49,778 --> 01:26:51,655
Come on, tell me.

1065
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:54,783
It's about establishing
a scholarship foundation.

1066
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:58,162
-What?
-It's a foundation that supports children

1067
01:26:58,245 --> 01:27:01,749
from low-income families, whether they be
in Korea or abroad,

1068
01:27:01,832 --> 01:27:05,461
and teaches classical music
if they're talented.

1069
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:09,465
Many companies do that nowadays.

1070
01:27:10,132 --> 01:27:13,928
I think we could send them
to a prestigious music college

1071
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:17,389
in Switzerland
where all the musical geniuses gather.

1072
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:19,099
Never mind.

1073
01:27:19,517 --> 01:27:22,019
Not everyone can do this.

1074
01:27:22,728 --> 01:27:25,397
What do you mean? We should do it.

1075
01:27:25,481 --> 01:27:27,107
Honey, do this.

1076
01:27:27,816 --> 01:27:29,860
You'll be raising musical geniuses.

1077
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:31,529
How awesome is that?

1078
01:27:31,612 --> 01:27:33,030
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

1079
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,658
Are you sure you can do it?

1080
01:27:35,741 --> 01:27:38,244
Look at her sounding me out.

1081
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:41,664
Do you think I wouldn't be able to do it?
It's a cakewalk.

1082
01:27:41,997 --> 01:27:44,875
Then I'll introduce you to a staff,
so get started.

1083
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,085
Fine.

1084
01:27:47,044 --> 01:27:49,088
Do you want to go to the department store
with me?

1085
01:27:49,171 --> 01:27:51,006
Okay. What do you want?

1086
01:27:51,298 --> 01:27:52,258
Keep me updated.

1087
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:53,759
-Bye.
-Okay.

1088
01:27:55,678 --> 01:27:59,348
You'll be supporting musical geniuses
from all around the world.

1089
01:28:00,015 --> 01:28:02,226
Honey, you're so awesome.

1090
01:28:03,185 --> 01:28:04,770
You truly are.

1091
01:28:04,853 --> 01:28:06,730
And this awesome man is yours.

1092
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:09,233
-You're the best.
-You're so awesome.

1093
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:14,488
ONE YEAR LATER

1094
01:29:15,299 --> 01:29:16,467
Did you not see him?

1095
01:29:20,012 --> 01:29:21,847
It won't be easy.

1096
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,432
The reporters are posting articles

1097
01:29:23,515 --> 01:29:26,018
about how Se-ri's Choice and Queens Group

1098
01:29:26,101 --> 01:29:28,729
have joined hands
in raising musical geniuses

1099
01:29:29,521 --> 01:29:33,025
and are holding performances
once a year in Switzerland.

1100
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:35,944
I'm reaching out to him

1101
01:29:36,028 --> 01:29:38,238
by posting these articles online.

1102
01:29:38,947 --> 01:29:41,700
But there's no guarantee
that he'll read them

1103
01:29:42,785 --> 01:29:47,081
or show up in Switzerland.

1104
01:29:48,957 --> 01:29:50,250
It breaks my heart

1105
01:29:50,334 --> 01:29:52,378
to see you return
in disappointment every time.

1106
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:56,674
Waiting for him

1107
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:59,134
is my only way of hanging in.

1108
01:30:06,725 --> 01:30:07,935
But Mom...

1109
01:30:08,811 --> 01:30:09,770
He...

1110
01:30:11,313 --> 01:30:13,107
found me every time.

1111
01:30:14,316 --> 01:30:15,984
No matter where I was.

1112
01:30:16,568 --> 01:30:17,569
He will

1113
01:30:19,822 --> 01:30:21,365
find me again someday.

1114
01:30:25,452 --> 01:30:26,453
You're right.

1115
01:30:27,454 --> 01:30:29,623
I'm rooting for you.

1116
01:30:33,794 --> 01:30:35,003
Should you be heading out?

1117
01:30:35,379 --> 01:30:37,423
I thought you were going to see Se-hyeong.

1118
01:30:37,631 --> 01:30:38,674
Right.

1119
01:30:39,174 --> 01:30:40,592
Our attorney is coming too.

1120
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:45,848
He's filing for divorce
while being incarcerated.

1121
01:30:45,931 --> 01:30:47,641
Even I haven't done that.

1122
01:30:48,559 --> 01:30:49,768
He's giving me a headache.

1123
01:30:49,852 --> 01:30:51,061
I should go now.

1124
01:30:52,312 --> 01:30:53,897
-Bye.
-Bye.

1125
01:31:08,203 --> 01:31:12,082
<i>Edelweiss symbolizes precious memories.</i>

1126
01:31:14,543 --> 01:31:16,545
<i>What should I do, Jeong Hyeok?</i>

1127
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:21,467
<i>It's impossible for me to cherish you
just as a memory.</i>

1128
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:24,428
<i>So even if</i>

1129
01:31:25,053 --> 01:31:26,805
<i>we don't meet this year,</i>

1130
01:31:27,306 --> 01:31:28,515
<i>Maybe next year.</i>

1131
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,768
<i>If that doesn't work too,</i>

1132
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:32,478
<i>I'll anticipate the year after.</i>

1133
01:31:33,771 --> 01:31:36,064
<i>Until the day you find me,</i>

1134
01:31:36,148 --> 01:31:37,441
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

1135
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:39,401
<i>and praying.</i>

1136
01:32:39,878 --> 01:32:41,755
<i>That's the decision I've made.</i>

1137
01:32:43,882 --> 01:32:46,552
<i>We only get to live one life.</i>

1138
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:50,514
<i>But I have decided to spend mine</i>

1139
01:32:51,765 --> 01:32:54,810
<i>encountering the love of my life,</i>

1140
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:57,062
<i>letting him go,</i>

1141
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:02,359
<i>and waiting to meet once again.</i>

1142
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,532
<i>That's what I've decided to do.</i>

1143
01:33:09,616 --> 01:33:11,076
<i>So if you feel the same way,</i>

1144
01:33:12,578 --> 01:33:14,204
<i>come to me.</i>

1145
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:02,002
I always do this.

1146
01:34:03,253 --> 01:34:05,589
I do well until right before the landing.

1147
01:34:09,092 --> 01:34:10,302
In life,

1148
01:34:10,969 --> 01:34:12,763
it's always the end that matters the most.

1149
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:18,143
I don't think your landing was that bad.

1150
01:34:18,852 --> 01:34:23,148
I mean, I did land successfully,
but the ropes are all entangled.

1151
01:34:23,774 --> 01:34:26,860
-I think you fell on the right spot.
-Look at this.

1152
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:33,575
No, let me correct myself.
You didn't fall.

1153
01:34:33,951 --> 01:34:35,452
You've descended.

1154
01:34:50,008 --> 01:34:51,468
I've missed you.

1155
01:35:17,661 --> 01:35:19,204
I knew it.

1156
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:23,792
I knew

1157
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:26,211
you'd be able...

1158
01:35:28,296 --> 01:35:30,465
to find me.

1159
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:36,388
But I still can't believe

1160
01:35:37,681 --> 01:35:39,433
you've come all the way here.

1161
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,564
It must've been difficult.

1162
01:35:46,064 --> 01:35:48,233
It must've been dangerous.

1163
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:50,444
How?

1164
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:53,739
How did you come here?

1165
01:35:56,742 --> 01:35:58,535
I got on the wrong train.

1166
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:08,045
And that very train brought me here.

1167
01:36:09,212 --> 01:36:11,339
It brought me to the place
I've yearned to come

1168
01:36:12,507 --> 01:36:14,342
every morning and night.

1169
01:36:17,596 --> 01:36:18,889
It brought me to my destination.

1170
01:37:42,097 --> 01:37:44,391
I heard you are very good at what you do

1171
01:37:44,474 --> 01:37:47,185
but only accept phone calls

1172
01:37:47,269 --> 01:37:49,354
instead of allowing your clients
to visit you.

1173
01:37:49,437 --> 01:37:52,357
A few years ago, I was arrested
by the control officers

1174
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,276
and had to spend some time behind bars.

1175
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,153
Oh, dear.

1176
01:37:56,236 --> 01:37:59,156
Goodness, it must've been tough.

1177
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:01,616
Don't get me started.

1178
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:04,286
It was so terrible

1179
01:38:04,369 --> 01:38:07,122
that the spirit that had possessed me
left me.

1180
01:38:09,124 --> 01:38:10,125
"Left"?

1181
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:13,128
Doesn't that mean
she's no longer spiritual?

1182
01:38:13,211 --> 01:38:14,546
<i>You're right.</i>

1183
01:38:14,629 --> 01:38:17,632
That's why I couldn't offer my services
for some time.

1184
01:38:17,716 --> 01:38:23,013
But recently,
a virgin ghost has possessed me.

1185
01:38:23,096 --> 01:38:25,724
That's why I have outstanding foresight
when it comes

1186
01:38:25,807 --> 01:38:28,643
to dating, marriage,
divorce, and remarriage.

1187
01:38:28,727 --> 01:38:31,146
That's great news!

1188
01:38:31,229 --> 01:38:34,399
When do you think
my daughter will get married?

1189
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:38,111
Let me see.

1190
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:56,922
There's only one man
who's the love of her life.

1191
01:38:57,005 --> 01:39:00,675
But three years ago, they parted ways.

1192
01:39:01,259 --> 01:39:04,221
That means there'll be
no more men in her life.

1193
01:39:04,804 --> 01:39:06,514
She's pretty good.

1194
01:39:06,598 --> 01:39:07,891
Shut up!

1195
01:39:07,974 --> 01:39:11,311
However, she'll become
extremely successful.

1196
01:39:11,394 --> 01:39:13,146
She'll go abroad quite often as well.

1197
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:16,733
With the amount of success she'll have,
she won't need a man.

1198
01:39:16,816 --> 01:39:19,694
But still,

1199
01:39:19,778 --> 01:39:22,197
she's going to be lonely.

1200
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:24,532
Could there be a solution to that?

1201
01:39:27,827 --> 01:39:30,080
The solution lies within the capital.

1202
01:39:30,664 --> 01:39:32,499
<i>She could find a man in one year,</i>

1203
01:39:32,582 --> 01:39:34,292
<i>six months,</i>

1204
01:39:34,376 --> 01:39:36,586
or even a month.

1205
01:39:37,254 --> 01:39:39,047
Which one do you prefer?

1206
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:40,340
Pay her!

1207
01:39:44,344 --> 01:39:45,512
What are you doing?

1208
01:39:47,305 --> 01:39:50,892
I heard this fortuneteller was good.

1209
01:39:51,268 --> 01:39:53,436
I was wondering when you'd get married.

1210
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:57,148
Didn't you always tell me
to live a trendy lifestyle?

1211
01:39:57,565 --> 01:40:00,610
Then let's live that way.

1212
01:40:01,069 --> 01:40:04,197
Being single is the trend nowadays.

1213
01:40:04,281 --> 01:40:07,367
Well, you are right about that, but...

1214
01:40:08,034 --> 01:40:10,996
I'll be busy preparing for my performance
in Russia next month.

1215
01:40:11,246 --> 01:40:12,580
I'm going to rehearsal.

1216
01:40:12,956 --> 01:40:13,957
Okay.

1217
01:40:17,377 --> 01:40:19,879
Goodness, I know she's my daughter,

1218
01:40:19,963 --> 01:40:21,798
but she's just fabulous.

1219
01:40:22,632 --> 01:40:23,925
Ma'am.

1220
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:28,722
I'd like you to write
a one-month talisman.

1221
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:32,434
Myeong Eun, let her be.
She doesn't want to get married.

1222
01:40:32,517 --> 01:40:35,228
I never said it was for her.

1223
01:40:35,812 --> 01:40:38,023
Since she's so adamant about it,

1224
01:40:38,106 --> 01:40:41,318
I'll let her live a flourishing life.

1225
01:40:42,944 --> 01:40:44,279
But I'd like a man myself.

1226
01:40:46,281 --> 01:40:49,576
Give me the best one you have.

1227
01:41:17,729 --> 01:41:21,483
It's great news that you'll be moving
to Pyongyang,

1228
01:41:21,566 --> 01:41:23,360
but we'll miss you terribly.

1229
01:41:24,861 --> 01:41:27,030
If you don't want to
be looked down on there,

1230
01:41:27,113 --> 01:41:28,990
you must look sophisticated.

1231
01:41:29,074 --> 01:41:31,159
Stop by my salon to get your hair done.

1232
01:41:31,242 --> 01:41:33,620
I'll give you the Goodbye Hairstyle.

1233
01:41:34,954 --> 01:41:36,289
Thank you.

1234
01:41:36,956 --> 01:41:39,918
I guess that fortuneteller
wasn't that bad.

1235
01:41:40,001 --> 01:41:41,711
In any case, they are going far away.

1236
01:41:42,295 --> 01:41:45,799
It's great news that they're leaving
to live a better life.

1237
01:41:46,383 --> 01:41:48,635
For the past 30 years, her husband
worked in the dark

1238
01:41:48,718 --> 01:41:50,929
while eavesdropping on others.

1239
01:41:51,012 --> 01:41:53,640
Now, he finally gets to work
under the sun.

1240
01:41:54,682 --> 01:41:58,728
You're right.
It's all thanks to Jeong Hyeok.

1241
01:41:58,812 --> 01:41:59,854
That's right.

1242
01:42:00,063 --> 01:42:03,525
By the way, didn't you say
that he got a job

1243
01:42:03,608 --> 01:42:06,945
at 4.25 Arts Film Studio?

1244
01:42:07,028 --> 01:42:08,780
Yes, you're correct.

1245
01:42:08,863 --> 01:42:12,409
Then, what exactly does he do there?

1246
01:42:34,139 --> 01:42:36,808
Products from the South?
We sell no such things.

1247
01:42:36,891 --> 01:42:39,727
Are you positive?

1248
01:42:40,353 --> 01:42:43,022
I heard they bought them here.

1249
01:42:43,106 --> 01:42:44,399
That's impossible.

1250
01:42:46,609 --> 01:42:49,946
Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.

1251
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:52,991
I can't bear to take showers without them.

1252
01:42:53,074 --> 01:42:56,244
What? You look like you'd manage
without a bar of soap.

1253
01:42:57,412 --> 01:42:59,456
Anyway, we don't have them here.

1254
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:03,001
Gosh. We're not control officers.

1255
01:43:04,919 --> 01:43:07,172
-You're not?
-He may look like this,

1256
01:43:08,256 --> 01:43:11,176
but he's our captain.

1257
01:43:11,843 --> 01:43:12,844
Hey.

1258
01:43:16,222 --> 01:43:19,267
This is the most popular one these days.

1259
01:43:19,476 --> 01:43:21,186
It's a new kind of shampoo.

1260
01:43:21,269 --> 01:43:22,353
It's from Se-ri's Choice.

1261
01:43:22,437 --> 01:43:23,480
"Se-ri..."

1262
01:43:26,649 --> 01:43:28,902
Is this really that popular?

1263
01:43:28,985 --> 01:43:30,487
Of course.

1264
01:43:30,737 --> 01:43:31,905
It's the number-one best.

1265
01:43:33,281 --> 01:43:37,202
That wench must be making a ton of money.

1266
01:43:37,285 --> 01:43:38,703
You're right.

1267
01:43:41,122 --> 01:43:42,290
I miss her.

1268
01:43:43,583 --> 01:43:44,709
I miss my sister.

1269
01:43:45,793 --> 01:43:47,378
Sister, my foot.

1270
01:43:49,088 --> 01:43:52,592
I wonder if Captain Ri
has departed already.

1271
01:43:53,426 --> 01:43:55,011
When we talked last week,

1272
01:43:55,094 --> 01:43:57,013
he said he was departing this weekend.

1273
01:43:57,096 --> 01:43:58,890
He must have left already.

1274
01:44:00,183 --> 01:44:01,643
And I'm sure Se-ri is there as well.

1275
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:12,987
As you can see, the customers

1276
01:44:14,447 --> 01:44:15,615
love it.

1277
01:44:19,494 --> 01:44:20,662
That's great.

1278
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:21,871
Good work, everyone.

1279
01:44:23,581 --> 01:44:24,832
You can go home now.

1280
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:26,876
Right. I'm sure you all know

1281
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,087
that I'll be on a two-week vacation
starting tomorrow.

1282
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:30,838
If something urgent pops up,

1283
01:44:33,341 --> 01:44:36,094
decide what to do among yourselves
and push forward with it.

1284
01:44:36,177 --> 01:44:40,682
My phone will be turned off.
I don't want any of you to call me.

1285
01:44:41,474 --> 01:44:43,268
Ma'am, are you going to Switzerland again?

1286
01:44:43,351 --> 01:44:45,812
Did you hide treasure there or something?

1287
01:44:45,895 --> 01:44:49,274
You're not Heidi,
so why do you keep going there?

1288
01:44:49,357 --> 01:44:50,358
Goodbye.

1289
01:44:52,068 --> 01:44:54,320
-It's a guy, right?
-It's lasting a while this time.

1290
01:44:54,404 --> 01:44:55,405
I think he's a foreigner.

1291
01:44:55,488 --> 01:44:56,990
It's a long-distance one, right?

1292
01:44:57,073 --> 01:45:00,493
We may have to write up
an English press release.

1293
01:46:03,681 --> 01:46:04,891
-Hello.
-Hi.

1294
01:46:04,974 --> 01:46:07,059
-Sorry, I'm too late.
-That's okay.

1295
01:46:07,435 --> 01:46:08,644
How was your flight?

1296
01:46:08,728 --> 01:46:09,896
It was good.

1297
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:13,953
Thank you for coming
and your patronage each year.

1298
01:46:14,066 --> 01:46:15,443
It's my pleasure.

1299
01:46:15,526 --> 01:46:17,904
They are exceptional students
this year as well.

1300
01:46:17,987 --> 01:46:19,280
It's all because of you

1301
01:46:19,363 --> 01:46:21,199
and your company
have donated the scholarship

1302
01:46:21,282 --> 01:46:24,035
for them in a stable and regular basis.

1303
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:29,707
Very talented artists are
participating in the concert.

1304
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:33,294
We also have participants
from North Korea this year as well.

1305
01:46:35,296 --> 01:46:37,840
Right. That's great.

1306
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:43,596
Would you stay here for 2 weeks,
this time as well?

1307
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:45,556
Yes. Well...

1308
01:46:46,098 --> 01:46:47,099
